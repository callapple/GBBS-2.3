The  following is a list of some of the

         [ Command (?=Help): ]

This is the main System Prompt of  GBBS
"PRO".  This system has a 128 character
type  ahead buffer which means you  can
type  characters before you come to  an
option   (except  during  the  system's
read/write activity of the disk drive).
If  you made a mistake in typing  some-
thing  you wish to  cancel,  a  "[CTRL]
[^]"  (Control Shift 6) will clear  the
buffer  of commands that have not  been
processed.

[ B ]  [B] gives you access to the Main
       Bulletin  Board  on the  system.
From  here you can type a question mark
to see a list of commands and get  more
help.   You  also have access to all of
the other bulletin boards on the system
from this point.

[ B# ] If  you type [B#] you will  have
       access directly to that Bulletin
Board  from  the system as long  as  it
exists and you have access to it. (i.e.
"B6" puts you on Board 6).
