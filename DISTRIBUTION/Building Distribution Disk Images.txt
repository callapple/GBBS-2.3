Building GBBS Pro distribution disks

1. Be sure to build all the new systems

2. Write down the # suffixes for the files you will overwrite in step 3

3. Copy the new object code files to the appropriate folder herein:

	GBBS.CONFIG
		CONFIG.SYSTEM
		ACOS
		ACOS.OBJ
		ENCODE

3. Update the filenames of the files copied in step 3 with the information written down in step 2. (This information is used by Cadius to correctly copy files from the native OS to a ProDOS disk image).

4. Use Cadius to copy the changed files in GBBS.CONFIG to the appropriate po file in the Disk Images folder.

Example in OS X terminal with the working directory in the Distribution folder:

	cadius replacefile Disk_Images/GBBS.CONFIG.po /GBBS.CONFIG/ GBBS.CONFIG/config.system#FF2000

Cadius does not support (at the time this was written) copying more than one file at a time back to ProDOS disk image.
