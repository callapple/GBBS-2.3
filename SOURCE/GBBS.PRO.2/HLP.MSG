    [ [B1,1-##] Option (?=Help): ]

The  Option  Menu  Bar tells  you  what
Board you are presently on and how many
bulletins on posted on that board.  "B"
from  the  main system sent you to  the
main bulletin board.  From here you can
type  a  question   mark  to  see   the
following list of commands:

   [ Bulletin Board Help Menu Bar ]
   --------------------------------

[ Read Number,  N)ew, F)orward, S)can ]
[ B)rowse, M)arked, G)lobal Quickscan ]
[ J)ump,  P)ost, K)ill,  H)elp, Q)uit ]

[ B ]  This will permit you to [B]rowse
       through  the message subjects of
a  bulletin  board to find all  of  the
bulletins  that  are  on  a  particular
subject.   Just type in the subject you
wish  to  search  on and you   will  be
asked if you wish to [ Mark  Messages ]
after  each  title.  If you answer  [Y]
this will allow you to read the  bulle-
tins you [M]arked when you are finished
viewing the titles.  After 15 bulletins
titles are displayed, you will be asked
if you wish to see more titles.  If you
have  been  on the system  before,  you
will  see a ">" in front of the  number
of the titles you have not yet read.
 
[ F ]  You  can list all the  bulletins
       starting  [F]orward at a partic-
ular number.
 
[ G ]  [G]lobal Quickscan will scan all
       of the boards you have access to
for new bulletins.   If a board has new
bulletins,  you  will be asked [ [R]ead
[S]kip [Q]uit ?  ].   [R] will let  you
read all of the new bulletins, [S] will
skip  to the next board,  and [Q]  will
quit Global Quickscan.
 
[ H ]  This  [H]elp  file is  displayed
       using this command.

[ J ]  [J]ump   to   another   bulletin
       board.  If you type [J#] you can
jump directly to that board number.  If
you type "J [RETURN]" it will list  all
of the boards on the system and you can
type in the number of the one you want.
If  you do not have access to them  you
will  get the message,  [ Security  too
low ].

[ K ]  [K]ills bulletins you have left.
 
[ M ]  When  you [S]can or [B]rowse the
       subjects  you will be  asked  if
you want to [ Allow marking? ] the mes-
sages  to read them after you pick them
with a [Yes/No/Quit] option.  The first
message  will print automatically  when
you are done.   Use the [N] command  to
see  the next ones you  marked.   After
you  have  finished reading the  marked
messages the first time,  [M] will dis-
play the same marked messages again.

[ N ]  This  retrieves [N]ew  bulletins
       that  have  been left since  the
last time you called.

[ P ]  [P]ost a bulletin  for all users
       to see.   You will be placed  in
the editor to enter your message.
 
[ Q ]  This will return you back to the
       main menu.

[ S ]  This  [S]cans  message  subjects
       starting at a certain number. If
you  wish  to [ Mark Messages ]   after
each title, you should answer [Y]. This
will  allow you to read  the  bulletins
you  "marked" when you are done reading
the titles.   After 15 bulletins titles
are displayed, you will be asked if you
wish to see more titles.   If you  have
been on the system before, you will see
a  ">"  in front of the number  of  the
titles you have not yet read.
 
[ # ]  The [Read Number]  option allows
       you  to  enter the number  of  a
bulletin  on  a  board  and  read  that
individual bulletin.

[A]uto reply [N]ext [R]e-read [Q]uit :
 
After displaying a message,  the  above
Menu Bar is displayed after each bulle-
tin  is shown.   You have the following
options:

[ A ]  [A]uto reply allows you to reply
       in one of two ways to the person
who wrote the message.  After you enter
[A] you are asked:  [ Is this a private
letter? ].  If you answer [Y] then  the
person receives the letter in his mail-
box.  If you  answer [N] then you  will
post a message on the board as a  reply
to the original message for everyone to
read.  You will use the editor to enter
the message  and when you are finished,
you will return to the Menu Bar.

[ N ]  [N]ext or a [RETURN] will go  to
       the next  bulletin on the board.

[ R ]  [R]e-read allows you to read the
       present bulletin again.

[ Q ]  [Q]uit will stop retrieving bul-
       letins  and  exit  back  to  the
Option Menu Bar.

[ + ]  This  command must be used after
       the  [F]orward  command  at  the
Menu  Bar  prompt.  First use  [F]  for
Forward;  then type the bulletin number
you  wish to start with.   At the first
menu  bar type a [+] and all  remaining
bulletins will fly by without stopping.
Use  this  when you want to  print  out
more than one bulletin at once  without
having  to  hit [N] after each one.  Or
use it to save  them all to a buffer to
view later when you log off.
