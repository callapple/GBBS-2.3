    [ Match letters (<CR>=All,?) ]

There are 4 options that may be used in
the  userlist command when you see  the
Userlist Menu Bar:

[1]  A blank <CR>.  This will list  all
     the users of this system.

[2]  If  you  type a [#] followed by  a
     number,  the system will show  you
     that user,  and all the users that
     follow.
 
[3]  A person's  full name.  The system
     will match the person if he is  on
     this system.
 
[4]  A partial,  first or last name. If
     you  forget a person's name,  need
     to  know  an  exact  spelling,  or
     don't know their user number  then
     you  can  find it by  telling  the
     system  as  much of the  first  or
     last name as you know, and it will
     print  the full name of users that
     fit the pattern.
