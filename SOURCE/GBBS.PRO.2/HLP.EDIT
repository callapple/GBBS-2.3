Type 'done' when finished '.h' for help

The  above two lines show that you  are
in  the editor.   The ## show the width
of  the message you are  typing  (which
you  can  change from the  main  menu).

The following commands are used in  the
editor.  They  are entered by  pressing
[CTRL]  plus the appropriate letter key
at the same time. All of these commands
can  be  used if the user  has  non-de-
structible backspacing (that is;  their
terminal program will not erase a char-
acter  when it backs over it).  If  the
user  does  not  have  non-destructible
backspacing, some of these commands may
not work.   You can set the curser from
the main menu.

[CTRL] [B]:  This command will move the
             cursor to the beginning of
             the  current line of  text
             that you are typing.

[CTRL] [C]:  This  command will  center
             the  current line of  text
             that you are typing.

[CTRL] [D]:  This  command will  delete
             the character that is  di-
             rectly  above  the  cursor
             and  shift all text  after
             the  cursor  one space  to
             the left.

[CTRL] [E]:  This command will move the
             cursor  to the end of  the
             current  line of text that
             you are typing.

[CTRL] [F]:  This command will insert a
             space  directly above  the
             cursor  and shift all text
             after the cursor one space
             to the right.

[CTRL] [H]:  Control   H  is  the  back
             space key. 

[CTRL] [I]:  This command will move the
             cursor  to  the  next  tab
             stop by printing eight  or
             less spaces.

[CTRL] [Q]:  This  command  will   move
             back  to the beginning  of
             the  word before the  cur-
             ser.

[CTRL] [T]:  This  command will  delete
             all   the  text  from  the
             cursor  to the end of  the
             current line of text  that
             you are typing.

[CTRL] [U]:  Control  U  will move  the
             curser forward one charac-
             ter.

[CTRL] [W]:  This  command  will   move
             forward  to the  beginning
             of the next word.

[CTRL] [X]:  This  command will  delete
             the  entire  line of  text
             that you are typing.

The  following dot commands are for the
expert,  and  can  only be used in  the
first  column of each line  within  the
editor  as you are typing in your  text
(they  will  not work in the middle  of
your text):

        -----------------------
        [ Editor Dot Commands ]
        -----------------------

[ .A ]  This command will automatically
        abort  your text entry.  Before
        it  clears the editor  it  will
        first  ask  you if you wish  to
        abort.
       
[ .D ]  If you enter a number after the
        .D command,  that corresponding
        line  of text will be  deleted.
        If  you enter a range of  lines
        (.Dx,y),   lines  x,y  will  be
        deleted.   To  delete the  last
        line entered use .DL.

[ .E ]  If you enter a number after the
        .E command,  that corresponding
        line of text will be edited. To
        edit the last line type .EL.

[ .H ]  This  will  print out  the  Dot
        command help file on the screen
        and  let you continue to  write
        your message.

[ .I ]  The .I command must be followed
        by a number. Upon entering this
        command,  you  will be able  to
        insert as many lines of text as
        you want.  Type 'Done' when you
        are  finished.  Typing .IL will
        insert before the last line.

[ .L ]  Typing  .L will list  the  con-
        tents  of the entire editor  to
        your screen.  (.Lx,y) will list
        the  lines  you want  to  view.
        Typing .LY will list the  lines
        with line numbers.

[ .N ]  Typing  .N  will allow  you  to
        erase the contents of the  edi-
        tor  and  enter new  text.  The
        system will ask you if you want
        to erase and start over.

[ .O ]  This dot command will save  the
        file  ("O.K.") without allowing
        you  to  edit the  file  again.
        This  is helpful if  you   have
        typed  in  the file before  you
        called  this  system  and  only
        want to upload your file.

[ .S ]  This command will automatically
        save  your message to disk.  It
        is  the same as the  ".O"  com-
        mand.

The following commands at the menu  bar
can  be  used  after you type  in  your

      append  at  the end of your  cur-
      rent text.

      [D]elete  one or more  lines.  If
      you  enter  [RETURN],   then  the
      attempt will be aborted.  You can
      also  issue  the [L]  command  to
      list a range of lines.

[E]:  You  can  [E]dit a line  of  your
      message by entering its line num-
      ber.   If you enter [L]  then you
      can list the message.

      using this command.

[I]:  Using    this  command  you   can
      [I]nsert  before the line  number
      you specify.  You can use the [L]
      command to list a range of lines.

[L]:  You  can  [L]ist your message  in
      part  or in whole.  You  will  be
      asked for a starting line number.
      If  you press  [RETURN] then  the
      entire message will be listed. If
      you enter a range of lines,  then
      only  those  lines will  be  dis-
      played.

[N]:  [N]  will allow you to erase  the
      contents  of the editor and enter
      new text. The system will ask you
      if  you  want to erase and  start
      over.

[O]:  This  stands for  [O]k.  It  says
      that  your  message is   complete
      and you wish to send it.
