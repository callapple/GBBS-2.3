You are lost in a swamp. The SWAMP CREATURE is after you and he's hungry!
You must "feel" your way to safety by tossing rocks into the swamp.

If you hear a THUD, the ground is solid.

If you hear a SPLASH, don't go in that direction.

Use your rocks wisely. Step in the direction you think is safe and keep
moving. If you fall in the swamp or the CREATURE gets you the game is over.

If you die, you lose 50 points. If you win, you get 100 points.
